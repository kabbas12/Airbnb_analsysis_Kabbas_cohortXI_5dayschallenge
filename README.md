Project Goal
The primary goal of building “Airbnb analysis educational project”  in python is to get proficiency over python coding, getting know-how about libraries like panda, numpy, plotly etc, data cleaning, removing outliers/abnormalities, visually representing the refined information and also providing in-sights and analysis. 
However this analysis is also useful for other students, Airbnb managers and analysts, fellow students, customers etc.
